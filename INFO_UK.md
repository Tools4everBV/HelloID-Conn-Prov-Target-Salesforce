Using the Salesforce Target Connector, you can connect Salesforce to various source systems via the identity & access management (IAM) solution HelloID by Tools4ever. Using this integration, you will take access rights and user account management to the next level, and automate these processes. The data from your source system is the leading factor here. In this article, you will discover more about this connector and its possibilities.

## What is Salesforce?

Salesforce is customer service management software, also known as customer relationship management (CRM). The solution was developed by the company of the same name. It collects customer-related data within your organisation in a central place and makes it accessible through a unified solution. This breaks down technological silos between departments and provides a complete picture of customers. 

## Why is a Salesforce connector useful?

For optimal productivity, employees need access to the right accounts, systems and data. At the same time, digital security is a critical concern for any business. With this in mind, youâ€™ll want to ensure that users never have unnecessary access rights, and you want the management of authorisations and user accounts is fully under control. You get this assurance by integrating your source systems with Salesforce via HelloID. The automation enabled by this integration prevents human errors, increases efficiency and optimises employee productivity. 

The Salesforce connector enables interfacing with common systems, including: 

*	Active Directory/Entra ID
* AFAS

You will find more details on integrating with these systems and other source systems later in the article.

## How HelloID integrates with Salesforce

You can connect Salesforce to HelloID as a target system and integrate it with your source systems. Several connectors are available to realise this integration: a connector based on Salesforce's SCIM API and a connector based on the company's APEX REST API. In both cases, we deploy the connector as the target connector. Both APIs allow you to manage user accounts. The SCIM API also allows managing permissions, something the APEX REST API does not support for now. 

The availability of two APIs gives you, the administrator, freedom of choice. Using the SCIM API is more standardised and in line with IAM, making it the preferred choice. However, if the capabilities of the SCIM API are not enough for your specific application, then the APEX API might offer a solution. This API offers more features, but is also more complex.

Integrating your source systems with Salesforce provides you with multiple possibilities, including:

*	Creating/updating Salesforce account: When a new employee joins the company, HelloID automatically creates a user account in Salesforce.

*	Assigning/unassigning Salesforce entitlements/roles: Based on source data, HelloID can also make a Salesforce account a member of an entitlement and/or role in Salesforce.


## HelloID for Salesforce helps you with

**Create accounts faster:** Thanks to the connection between your source systems and Salesforce via HelloID, Salesforce accounts for new users become available faster. HelloID automates this process, reducing your workload and ensuring that the employee can start working with the CRM system and access customer data immediately from day one. 

**Error-free account management:** The integration enables HelloID to add the email to the Salesforce account on the basis of the dependent account (Active Directory / Entra ID). The IAM solution ensures that you always adhere to the applicable policies, and also records all user- and authorisation-related activities in a log file. This ensures that you never skip a step, meet all compliance requirements and have a complete log file to demonstrate compliance. 

**Improved service levels and security:** The connection between your source systems and Salesforce takes the management of accounts and authorisations to the next level. This offers significant benefits in terms of digital security of both your organisation and its assets. For example, you prevent former employees' accounts from remaining active inadvertently or not revoking authorisations in time. This is important, because both mistakes can play into the hands of attackers and lead to significant damage. For instance, a security incident involving your CRM system can not only lead to customer data being leaked, resulting in damage to your reputation and image, it can also prevent you from accessing data needed to effectively support customers for a (longer) period of time. The more authorisations assigned to an account, the further an attacker can spread across your network and cause damage. You improve your service levels at the same time with this connector. You can help and support users faster, while employees can be optimally productive because they always have the right accounts and authorisations. At the same time, you spend less time correcting avoidable errors. 


## Connecting Salesforce to systems via HelloID

HelloID allows you to integrate several other systems with Salesforce, including a range of source systems. The integrations take the management of both user accounts and authorisations to the next level. Examples of common integrations include:

* **Microsoft Active Directory/Entra ID - Salesforce connector:** This integration keeps Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Entra ID - the new name of Azure Active Directory - and Salesforce fully in sync with each other, particularly important with Single Sign-On (SSO) in mind. This way, you take your security and user experience to the next level. At the same time, you improve productivity and simplify the management of both user accounts and authorisations.

* **AFAS - Salesforce connector:** The integration between AFAS and Salesforce allows your HR and IT departments to cooperate better and work more closely together. For example, when a new employee joins, HelloID can automatically create a Salesforce account and link this account to the right Salesforce group. This ensures a smooth and efficient provisioning process.

* **Exact Synergy - Salesforce connector:** Exact Synergy allows you to bring all your business processes together in one solution. The solution can, for example, combine your CRM, workflow, document management and projects in one integrated solution. The Exact Synergy - Salesforce integration ensures that you can also connect Salesforce to this solution via HelloID. 

HelloID offers support for more than 200 connectors. A wide range of integration options between your source systems and Salesforce is available. We are constantly expanding our range of connectors and integrations. You can therefore integrate HelloID with almost all popular systems. Are interested in what the possibilities are?
